Hi there!👋

I'm an enthusiastic developer who loves to continuously learn.

- 🪁 I use daily: `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.psd`, `.ai`
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, NodeJS, and MongoDB
- 💗 I’m interested in building an e-commerse site as my next passion project 
- 🛼 I also love to read, paint, and rollerskate
